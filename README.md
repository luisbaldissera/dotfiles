# Dotfiles

A set of my configuration files. Includes:

- Kitty
- VS Code
- Nvim

Run `./update.sh` to update the repository based on the PC configuration.

Run `./config.sh` to configure the PC based on the repository.

## TODO List

- Make better tab title for kitty

Maybe something like:

```plaintext
__/ title \__
```

- Automate `.zshrc` configuration

Adds it in the `./config.sh` consistently considering it can be merged to
current user configuration and not simply overrites.

- Adds more theme options for kitty

Consider see a subset of this repository `https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes`

- Build up minimalist .vim based in this set of configuration.

Maybe also create a build system for vim.
